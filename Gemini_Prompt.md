I want to achieve the following functionality, and I'll describe it to you. Then, you need to help me break down how to achieve this function into a specific implementation plan. This should include an overview of the project, a step-by-step breakdown of the modules needed, and the priority order of implementation. The technologies involved and how to implement them should also be included. I'll then give this plan to an AI coding agent to help implement this function.

The function I want to achieve is a web-based application that uses image recognition to identify the five fingers of my hand. It will use one of the fingers as a pointer-like feature for a virtual instrument. The higher my finger is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the sound that is played. Conversely, the lower my finger is, the lower and deeper the sound. The screen should display a scale like C, D, E, F, G, A, B, representing different natural notes. When my finger reaches the corresponding height, it should roughly play the pitch of that note. This is to be implemented on a webpage. So, first, analyze which technology stack can achieve this, and then write a step-by-step implementation plan.
